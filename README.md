## AutoHotkey v2 configuration for **thqby's** lsp using **nvim-lspconfig**

There may be a better way to do this without manually placing the server
configuration in lspconfig's plugin folder, but this is what I've got and 
it does work, so...

----

### First, find the plugin folder for lspconfig.

*For me*, this is at 
`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.local\share\nvim-data\site\pack\packer\start\nvim-lspconfig`

I have my `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_DATA_HOME` environment variables set to 
`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.config` and `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.local\share`, respectively. 
I prefer things to be as portable as possible as I reset my computer semi-frequently
(with the option to keep my user data) to clean things up (mainly dependencies 
for previous projects) and only keep what is necessary for my current workflows. 
On Windows, Neovim will by default just use `%LOCALAPPDATA%` (equivalent of 
`%APPDATA%\..\Local`) for both `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_DATA_HOME`. Your AppData 
folders are cleaned out when you reset Windows but everything else under 
`C:\Users\%USERNAME%` is kept, so Unix-style configuration locations help to keep 
things working with minimal effort after resetting my pc. But to sumize, the 
nvim-lspconfig folder will most likely be a descendant of 
`%LOCALAPPDATA\nvim-data\site\pack` with windows and 
`~/.local/share/nvim-data/site/pack` with Unix. Mine is also under 
`packer\start` since I installed it with Packer. You just have to find out 
where your plugins are installed according to your package manager.

The layout of nvim-lspconfig should look like this though:

```
.\lua
.\plugin
.\scripts
.\test
.\.codespellignorewords
.\.editorconfig
.\.gitignore
.\.luacheckrc
.\.stylua.toml
.\CONTRIBUTING.md
.\flake.lock
.\flake.nix
.\LICENSE.md
.\Makefile
.\neovim.yml
.\nvim-lspconfig-scm-1.rockspec
.\README.md
.\selene.toml
.\.git
.\.github
.\doc
```
The `nvim-lspconfig\lua` folder is where you want to be. Inside this folder, you've
got:

```
.\lspconfig\
    server_configurations\
        als.lua
        anakin_language_server.lua
        angularls.lua
        ansiblels.lua
        antlerls.lua
        apex_ls.lua
        arduino_language_server.lua
        asm_lsp.lua
        astro.lua
        awk_ls.lua
        bashls.lua
        beancount.lua
        ...
    ui\
        lspinfo.lua
        windows.lua
    configs.lua
    util.lua
.\lspconfig.lua
```
lspconfig uses the files in the `server_configurations` folder to provide
setup functions. The name of the file in `server_configurations` is what you use
to retrieve the function in your lua code: `require[[lspconfig]].<filename>.setup()`

### Add a new server configuration

You can just drop `ahk2_ls.lua` into `server_configurations` in the nvim-lspconfig
plugin folder. But you **have** to change some values to point to your server. 
There are also some options for formatting, comment tags, which libraries to 
auto-include, etc. There are comments and annotations in the `ahk2_ls.lua` file 
provided; just give it a look. You can set these options in the setup function
as well.

### Call setup function

I like to create wrappers for my plugin setup functions. So I have something 
akin to what's in the `lspconfig_setup.lua` file. If you placed it in nvim/lua, 
then in your nvim/init.lua, you'd just need to add 
`require'lspconfig_setup'.setup_ahk2_ls()`.

The reason I make a wrapper for it is so I can require my setup file and make changes 
to the setup options before I call the setup function, just in case I want to change
something from my init.lua instead of the required file, eg. Â»

```lua
local lspconf = require'lspconfig_setup'
lspconf.ahk2_setup_options.init_options.FormatOptions.max_preserve_newlines = 3
lspconf.setup_ahk2_ls()
```

It's totally unnecessary though, so you know, adapt it to fit your own configurations.
